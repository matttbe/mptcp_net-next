        Add any other context about the problem here.
        Note: It might help to get the output of  `ip mptcp monitor` while reproducing the issue, in addition to the output from these commands executed just before **and** after the issue:
        ```
        ss -ManiH
        nstat
        ```
        Packet traces (TCPDump / WireShark), configured IP addresses and routing can be helpful too. Check [here](https://www.mptcp.dev/debugging.html) for more details.
        mptcpd's [`/usr/libexec/mptcp-get-debug`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/multipath-tcp/mptcpd/refs/heads/main/scripts/mptcp-get-debug) script (mptcpd >= 0.13) can help to collect such infos.
