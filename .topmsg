Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: add missing oflag=append

In mptcp_connect.sh we are missing something like "oflag=append"
because this will write "${rem}" bytes at the beginning of the file
where there is already some random bytes. It should write that at
the end.

This patch adds this missing 'oflag=append' flag for 'dd' command in
make_file().
