Subject: [PATCH] selftests/bpf: Add bpf_red scheduler & test

This patch implements the redundant BPF MPTCP scheduler, named bpf_red,
which sends all packets redundantly on all available subflows.

Using MPTCP_SCHED_TEST macro to add a new test for this bpf_red
scheduler, the arguments "1 1" means data has been sent on both
net devices. Run this test by RUN_MPTCP_TEST macro.
