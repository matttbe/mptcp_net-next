Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: fix wait_rm_addr/sf parameters

The second input parameter of 'wait_rm_addr/sf $1 1' is misused. If it's
1, wait_rm_addr/sf will never break, and will loop ten times, then
'wait_rm_addr/sf' equals to 'sleep 1'. This delay time is too long,
which can sometimes make the tests failures.

A better way to use wait_rm_addr/sf is to use rm_addr/sf_count to obtain
the current value, and then pass into wait_rm_addr/sf.
