Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: move first subflow allocation at mpc access time

In the long run this will simplify the mptcp code and will
allow for more consistent behavior. Move the first subflow
allocation out of the sock->init ops into the __mptcp_nmpc_socket()
helper.

Since the first subflow creation can now happen after the first
setsockopt() we additionally need to invoke mptcp_sockopt_sync()
on it.
