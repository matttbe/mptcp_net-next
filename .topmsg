Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: declare event macros in mptcp_lib

MPTCP event macros (SUB_ESTABLISHED, LISTENER_CREATED, LISTENER_CLOSED),
and the protocol family macros (AF_INET, AF_INET6) are defined in both
mptcp_join.sh and userspace_pm.sh. In order not to duplicate code, this
patch declares them all in mptcp_lib.sh with MPTCP_LIB_ prefixs.
