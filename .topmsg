Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: add missing kconfig for NF Filter in v6

Since the commit mentioned below, 'mptcp_join' selftests is using
IPTables to add rules to the Filter table for IPv6.

It is then required to have IP6_NF_FILTER KConfig.

This KConfig is usually enabled by default in many defconfig, but we
recently noticed that some CI were running our selftests without them
enabled.
