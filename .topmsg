Subject: [PATCH] DO-NOT-MERGE: git markup: net-next

All commits older than this one are from Netdev's net-next repo:

  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/netdev/net-next.git/

Following commits are fixes for other trees than the net ones or
imported from elsewhere. We should not send these commits to either -net
or net-next.

This commit is useful to easily find the "bottom of the tree".
