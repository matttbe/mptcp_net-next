Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: depend on SYN_COOKIES

MPTCP selftests are using TCP SYN Cookies for quite a while now, since
v5.9.

Some CIs don't have this config option enabled and this is causing
issues in the tests:

  # ns1 MPTCP -> ns1 (10.0.1.1:10000      ) MPTCP     (duration   167ms) sysctl: cannot stat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_syncookies: No such file or directory
  # [ OK ]./mptcp_connect.sh: line 554: [: -eq: unary operator expected

There is no impact in the results but the test is not doing what it is
supposed to do.

Fixes: fed61c4b584c ("selftests: mptcp: make 2nd net namespace use tcp syn cookies unconditionally")
