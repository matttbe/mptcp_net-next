Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: avoid bogus reset on fallback close

Since the blamed commit, the MPTCP protocol unconditionally sends
TCP resets on all the subflows on disconnect().

That fits full-blown MPTCP sockets - to implement the fastclose
mechanism - but causes unexpected corruption of the data stream,
caught as sporadic self-tests failures.

Fixes: d21f83485518 ("mptcp: use fastclose on more edge scenarios")
