Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: display simult in extra_msg

Just like displaying "invert" after "Info: ", "simult" should be
displayed too when rm_subflow_nr doesn't match the expect value in
chk_rm_nr():

      syn                                 [ ok ]
      synack                              [ ok ]
      ack                                 [ ok ]
      add                                 [ ok ]
      echo                                [ ok ]
      rm                                  [ ok ]
      rmsf                                [ ok ] 3 in [2:4]
      Info: invert simult

      syn                                 [ ok ]
      synack                              [ ok ]
      ack                                 [ ok ]
      add                                 [ ok ]
      echo                                [ ok ]
      rm                                  [ ok ]
      rmsf                                [ ok ]
      Info: invert
