Subject: [PATCH] net: mptcp: convert netlink from small_ops to ops

in the current MPTCP control plane, all operations use a netlink
attribute of the same type "MPTCP_PM_ATTR". However, add/del/get/flush
operations only parse the first element in the message _ the one that
describes MPTCP endpoints (that was named MPTCP_PM_ATTR_ADDR and
mostly used in ADD_ADDR operations _ probably the similarity of "attr",
"addr" and "add" might cause some confusion to human readers).
Convert MPTCP from 'small_ops' to 'ops', thus allowing different attributes
for each single operation, hopefully makes all this clearer to human
readers.

- use a separate attribute set for add/del/get/flush address operation,
  binary compatible with the existing one, to store the endpoint address.
  MPTCP_PM_ENDPOINT_ADDR is added to the uAPI (with the same value as
  MPTCP_PM_ATTR_ADDR) for these operations.
- convert mptcp_pm_ops[] and add policy files accordingly.

this prepares MPTCP control plane to be described as YAML spec.
