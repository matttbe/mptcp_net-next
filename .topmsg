Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: userspace: refactor asserts

Instead of having a long list of conditions to check, it is possible to
give a list of variable names to compare with their 'e_XXX' version.

This will ease the introduction of the following commit which will print
which condition has failed (if any).
