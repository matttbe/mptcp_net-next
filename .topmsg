Subject: [PATCH] selftests: net: lib: support errexit with busywait

If errexit is enabled ('set -e'), loopy_wait -- or busywait and others
using it -- will stop after the first failure.

Note that if the returned status of loopy_wait is checked, and even if
errexit is enabled, Bash will not stop at the first error.
