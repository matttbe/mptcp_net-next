Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: join: correctly check for no RST

The commit mentioned below was more tolerant with the number of RST seen
during a test because in some uncontrollable situations, multiple RST
can be generated.

But it was not taking into account the case where no RST are expected:
this validation was then no longer reporting issues for the 0 RST case
because it is not possible to have less than 0 RST in the counter. This
patch fixes the issue by adding a specific condition.
