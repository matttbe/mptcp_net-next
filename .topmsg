Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: join: fix dev in check_endpoint

There's a bug in pm_nl_check_endpoint(), 'dev' didn't be parsed correctly.
If calling it in the 2nd test of endpoint_tests() too, it fails with an
error like this:

 creation  [FAIL] expected '10.0.2.2 id 2 subflow dev dev' \
                     found '10.0.2.2 id 2 subflow dev ns2eth2'

The reason is '$2' should be set to 'dev', not '$1'. This patch fixes it.
