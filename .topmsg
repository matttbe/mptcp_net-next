Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: implement mptcp_pm_connection_closed

The MPTCP path manager event handler mptcp_pm_connection_closed
interface has been added in the commit 1b1c7a0ef7f3 ("mptcp: Add path
manager interface") but it was an empty function from then on.

With such name, it sounds good to invoke mptcp_event with the
MPTCP_EVENT_CLOSED event type from it. It also removes a bit of
duplicated code.
