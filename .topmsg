Subject: [PATCH] selftests/bpf: Add getsockopt to inspect mptcp subflow

This patch adds a "cgroup/getsockopt" way to inspect the subflows of an
mptcp socket. That will be used by the next commit to verify the socket
options set on each subflow.

This extra "cgroup/getsockopt" prog walks the msk->conn_list and use
bpf_core_cast to cast a pointer for readonly. It allows to inspect all
the fields of a structure.

mptcp_subflow_tcp_sock(), mptcp_for_each_stubflow() and other helpers
related to list_entry have been added into a new progs/mptcp_bpf.h file.
