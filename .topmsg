Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: gives slow test-case more time

On slow or busy VM, some test-cases still fail because the
data transfer completes before the endpoint manipulation
actually took effect.

Address the issue by artificially increasing the runtime for
the relevant test-cases.

Fixes: ef360019db40 ("selftests: mptcp: signal addresses testcases")
