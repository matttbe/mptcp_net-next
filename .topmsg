Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: fix setsockopt(IP_TOS) subflow locking

The MPTCP implementation of the IP_TOS socket option uses the lockless
variant of the TOS manipulation helper and does not hold such lock at
the helper invocation time.

Add the required locking.

Fixes: ffcacff87cd6 ("mptcp: Support for IP_TOS for MPTCP setsockopt()")
