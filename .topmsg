Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: run userspace pm tests slower

Some userspace pm tests failed are reported by CI:

112 userspace pm add & remove address
      syn                                 [ ok ]
      synack                              [ ok ]
      ack                                 [ ok ]
      add                                 [ ok ]
      echo                                [ ok ]
      mptcp_info subflows=1:1             [ ok ]
      subflows_total 2:2                  [ ok ]
      mptcp_info add_addr_signal=1:1      [ ok ]
      rm                                  [ ok ]
      rmsf                                [ ok ]
      Info: invert
      mptcp_info subflows=0:0             [ ok ]
      subflows_total 1:1                  [fail]
                         got subflows 0:0 expected 1:1
Server ns stats
TcpPassiveOpens                 2                  0.0
TcpInSegs                       118                0.0

This patch fixes them by change 'speed' to 5 to run the tests much more
slower.
