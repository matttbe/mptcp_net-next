Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: update and extend fastclose test-cases

After the previous patches, the MPTCP protocol can generate
fast-closes on both ends of the connection. Rework the relevant
test-case to carefully trigger the fast-close code-path on a
single end at the time, while ensuring than a predictable amount
of data is spooled on both ends.

Additionally add another test-cases for the passive socket
fast-close.
