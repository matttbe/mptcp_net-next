Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: userspace pm: uniform verify events

Simply adding a "sleep" before checking something is usually not a good
idea because the time that has been picked can not be enough or too
much. The best is to wait for events with a timeout.

In this selftest, 'sleep 0.5' is used more than 40 times. It is always
used before calling a 'verify_*' function except for this
verify_listener_events which has been added later.

At the end, using all these 'sleep 0.5' seems to work: the slow CIs
don't complain so far. Also because it doesn't take too much time, we
can just add two more 'sleep 0.5' to uniform what is done before calling
a 'verify_*' function. For the same reasons, we can also delay a bigger
refactoring to replace all these 'sleep 0.5' by functions waiting for
events instead of waiting for a fix time and hope for the best.
