Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: check the protocol in mptcp_sk() with DEBUG_NET

Fuzzers and static checkers might not detect when mptcp_sk() is used
with a non mptcp_sock structure.

This is similar to the parent commit, where it is easy to use mptcp_sk()
with a TCP sock, e.g. with a subflow sk.

So a new simple check is done when CONFIG_DEBUG_NET is enabled to tell
kernel devs when a non-MPTCP socket is being used as an MPTCP one.
'mptcp_sk()' macro is then defined differently: with an extra WARN to
complain when an unexpected socket is being used.
