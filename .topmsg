Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: diag: return KSFT_FAIL not test_cnt

The test counter 'test_cnt' should not be returned in diag.sh, e.g. what
if only the 4th test fail? Will do 'exit 4' which is 'exit ${KSFT_SKIP}',
the whole test will be marked as skipped instead of 'failed'!

So we should do ret=${KSFT_FAIL} instead.
