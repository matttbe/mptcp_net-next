Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: pm_nl_ctl: remove re-definition

'MPTCP_PM_NAME' is defined in 'linux/mptcp_pm.h', included in
'linux/mptcp.h', no need to re-define it.

'MPTCP_PM_EVENTS' is not defined in 'linux/mptcp.h', but
'MPTCP_PM_EV_GRP_NAME' is, with the same value. We can then use the
latter, and drop the other one.
