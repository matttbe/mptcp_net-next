Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: diag: unique 'in use' subtest names

It is important to have a unique (sub)test name in TAP, because some CI
environments drop tests with duplicated name.

Some 'in use' subtests from the diag selftest had the same names, e.g.:

    chk 0 msk in use after flush

Now the previous value is taken, to have different names, e.g.:

    chk 2->0 msk in use after flush

While at it, avoid repeating the full message, declare it once in the
helper.
