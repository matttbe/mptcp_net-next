Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: userspace pm send RM_ADDR for ID 0

This patch adds the ability to send RM_ADDR for local ID 0. Check
whether id 0 address is removed, if not, put id 0 into a removing
list, pass it to mptcp_pm_remove_addr() to remove id 0 address.

There is no reason not to allow the userspace to remove the initial
address (ID 0). This special case was not taken into account not
letting the userspace to delete all addresses as announced.
