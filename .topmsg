Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: fix lockless access in subflow ULP diag

Since the introduction of the subflow ULP diag interface, the
dump callback accessed all the subflow data with lockless.

We need either to annotate all the read and write operation accordingly,
or acquire the subflow socket lock. Let's do latter, even if slower, to
avoid a diffstat havoc.
