Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: sockopt: skip TCP_INQ checks if not supported

Selftests are supposed to run on any kernels, including the old ones not
supporting all MPTCP features.

One of them is TCP_INQ cmsg support introduced in commit 2c9e77659a0c
("mptcp: add TCP_INQ cmsg support").

It is possible to look for "mptcp_ioctl" in kallsyms because it was
needed to introduce the mentioned feature. We can skip these tests and
not set TCPINQ option if the feature is not supported.
