Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: pm: fix backup support in signal endpoints

There was a support for signal endpoints, but only when the endpoint's
flag was changed during a connection. If an endpoint with the signal and
backup was already present, the MP_JOIN reply was not containing the
backup flag as expected.

That's confusing to have this inconsistent behaviour. On the other hand,
the infrastructure to set the backup flag in the SYN + ACK + MP_JOIN was
already there, it was just never set before. Now when requesting the
local ID from the path-manager, the backup status is also requested.

Note that when the userspace PM is used, the backup flag can be set if
the local address was already used before with a backup flag, e.g. if
the address was announced with the 'backup' flag, or a subflow was
created with the 'backup' flag.

Fixes: 4596a2c1b7f5 ("mptcp: allow creating non-backup subflows")
