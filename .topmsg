Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: sockopt: skip getsockopt checks if not supported

Selftests are supposed to run on any kernels, including the old ones not
supporting all MPTCP features.

One of them is the getsockopt(SOL_MPTCP) to get info about the MPTCP
connections introduced by commit 55c42fa7fa33 ("mptcp: add MPTCP_INFO
getsockopt") and the following ones.

It is possible to look for "mptcp_diag_fill_info" in kallsyms because
it is introduced by the mentioned feature. So we can know in advance if
the feature is supported and skip the sub-test if not.
