Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: fix mibit vs mbit mix up

The estimated time was supposing the rate was expressed in mibit
(bit * 1024^2) but it is in mbit (bit * 1000^2).

This makes the threshold higher but in a more realistic way to avoid
false positives reported by CI instances.

Before this patch, the thresholds were at 7561/4005ms and now they are
at 7906/4178ms.

While at it, also fix a typo in the linked comment, spotted by Mat.
