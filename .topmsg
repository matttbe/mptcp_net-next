Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: only send RM_ADDR in nl_cmd_remove

The specifications from [1] about the "REMOVE" command say:

    Announce that an address has been lost to the peer

It was then only supposed to send a RM_ADDR and not trying to delete
associated subflows.

A new helper mptcp_pm_remove_addrs() is then introduced to do just
that, compared to mptcp_pm_remove_addrs_and_subflows() also removing
subflows.

To delete a subflow, the userspace daemon can use the "SUB_DESTROY"
command, see mptcp_nl_cmd_sf_destroy().
