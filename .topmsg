Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: prevent excessive coalescing on receive

Currently the skb size after coalescing is only limited by the skb
layout (the skb must not carry frag_list). A single coalesced skb
covering several MSS can potentially fill completely the receive
buffer. In such a case, the snd win will zero until the receive buffer
will be empty again, affecting tput badly.
