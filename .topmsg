Subject: [PATCH] doc: new 'mptcp' page in 'networking'

A global documentation about MPTCP was missing since its introduction in
v5.6.

Most of what is there comes from our recently updated mptcp.dev website,
with additional links to resources from the kernel documentation.

This is a first version, mainly targeting app developers and users.
