Subject: [PATCH] bpf: Allow use of skc_to_mptcp_sock in cg_sockopt

Currently, bpf_skc_to_mptcp_sock() helper is not allowed to be used
in cg_sockopt. This patch adds this permission.

Thanks to the previous patch allowing skc_to_mptcp_sock() to be used
with MPTCP sockets, this permission allows this helper to be use it in
CGroup BPF hooks, e.g. [gs]etsocktopt.
