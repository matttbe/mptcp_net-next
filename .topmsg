Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: propagate fastclose error

When an mptcp socket is closed due to an incoming FASTCLOSE
option, so specific sk_err is set and later syscall will
fail usually with EPIPE.

Align the current fastclose error handling with TCP reset,
properly setting the socket error according to the current
msk state and propagating such error.

Additionally sendmsg() is currently not handling properly
the sk_err, always returning EPIPE.
