Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: userspace: validate v4-v6 subflows mix

MPTCP protocol supports having subflows in both IPv4 and IPv6. In Linux,
it is possible to have that if the MPTCP socket has been created with
AF_INET6 family without the IPV6_V6ONLY option.

Here, a new IPv4 subflow is being added to the initial IPv6 connection,
then being removed using Netlink commands.
