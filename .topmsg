Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: userspace_pm: unique subtest names

It is important to have a unique (sub)test name in TAP, because some CI
environments drop tests with duplicated names.

Some subtests from the userspace_pm selftest had the same names. That's
because different subflows are created (and deleted) between the same
pair of IP addresses.

Simply adding the destination port in the name is then enough to have
different names, because the destination port is always different.

Note that adding such info takes a bit more space, so we need to
increase a bit the width to print the name, simply to keep all the
'[ OK ]' aligned as before.
