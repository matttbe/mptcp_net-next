Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: sockopt: relax expected returned size

Selftests are supposed to run on any kernels, including the old ones not
supporting all MPTCP features.

One of them is the getsockopt(SOL_MPTCP) to get info about the MPTCP
connections introduced by commit 55c42fa7fa33 ("mptcp: add MPTCP_INFO
getsockopt") and the following ones.

We cannot guess in advance which sizes the kernel will returned: older
kernel can returned smaller sizes, e.g. recently the tcp_info structure
has been modified in commit 71fc704768f6 ("tcp: add rcv_wnd and
plb_rehash to TCP_INFO") where a new field has been added.

The userspace can also expect a smaller size if it is compiled with old
uAPI kernel headers.

So for these sizes, we can only check if they are above a certain
threshold, 0 for the moment. We can also only compared sizes with the
ones set by the kernel.
