Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: really cope with fastopen race

Fastopen and PM-trigger subflow shutdown can race, as reported by
syzkaller.

In my first attempt to close such race, I missed the fact that
the subflow status can change again before the subflow_state_change
callback is invoked.

Address the issue additionally copying with all the states directly
reachable from TCP_FIN_WAIT1.

Fixes: 1e777f39b4d7 ("mptcp: add MSG_FASTOPEN sendmsg flag support")
Fixes: 4fd19a307016 ("mptcp: fix inconsistent state on fastopen race")
