Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: make evts global in userspace_pm

This patch makes server_evts and client_evts global in userspace_pm.sh,
then these two variables could be used in test_announce(), test_remove()
and test_subflows(). The local variable 'evts' in these three functions
then could be dropped.

Also move local variable 'file' as a global one.
