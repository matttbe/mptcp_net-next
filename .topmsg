Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: add annotations around sk->sk_shutdown accesses

Christoph reported the mptcp variant of a recently addressed plain
TCP issue. Similar to commit e14cadfd80d7 ("tcp: add annotations around
sk->sk_shutdown accesses") add READ/WRITE ONCE annotations to silence
KCSAN reports around lockless sk_shutdown access.

Fixes: 71ba088ce0aa ("mptcp: cleanup accept and poll")
