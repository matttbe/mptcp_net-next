Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: avoid additional __inet_stream_connect() call

The mptcp protocol maintains an additional socket just to easily
invoke a few stream operations on the first subflow. One of them is
__inet_stream_connect().

We are going to remove the first subflow socket soon, so avoid
the additional indirection via at connect time, calling directly
into the sock-level connect() ops.

No functional change intended.
