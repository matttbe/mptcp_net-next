Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: remove unneeded lock when listing scheds

mptcp_get_available_schedulers() needs to iterate over the schedulers'
list only to read the names: it doesn't modify anything there.

In this case, it is enough to hold the RCU read lock, no need to combine
this with the associated spin lock.

Fixes: 73c900aa3660 ("mptcp: add net.mptcp.available_schedulers")
