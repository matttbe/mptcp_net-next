Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: relax check on MPC passive fallback

While testing the blamed commit below, I was able to miss (!)
packetdrill failures in the fastopen test-cases.

On passive fastopen the child socket is created by incoming TCP MPC syn,
allow for both MPC_SYN and MPC_ACK header.

Fixes: 724b00c12957 ("mptcp: refine opt_mp_capable determination")
