Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: add annotations around msk->subflow accesses

The MPTCP can access the first subflow socket in a few spots
outside the socket lock scope. That is actually safe, as MPTCP
will delete the socket itself only after the msk sock close().

Still the such accesses causes a few KCSAN splats, as reported
by Christoph. Silence the harmless warning adding a few annotation
around the relevant accesses.
