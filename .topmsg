Subject: [PATCH] netlink: specs: mptcp: fix missing doc

Two operations didn't have a small description. It looks like something
that has been missed in the original commit introducing this file.

Replace the two "todo" by a small and simple description: Create/Destroy
subflow.

While at it, also uniform the capital letters, avoid double spaces, and
fix the "announce" event description: a new "address" has been
announced, not a new "subflow".
