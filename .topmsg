Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: use "middlebox interference" for MP_TCPRST in case map_valid is false

RFC8684 suggests use of "Middlebox interference (code 0x06)" in case of
fully established subflow that carries data at TCP level with no DSS
sub-option.

This is generally the case when mpext is NULL or mpext->use_map is 0:
use a dedicated value of 'mapping_status' and use it before closing the
socket in subflow_check_data_avail().
