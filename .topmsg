Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: pm: do not remove closing subflows

In a previous fix, the in-kernel path-manager has been modified not to
retrigger the removal of a subflow if it was already closed, e.g. when
the initial subflow is removed, but kept in the subflows list.

To be complete, this fix should also skip the subflows that are in any
closing state: mptcp_close_ssk() will initiate the closure, but the
switch to the TCP_CLOSE state depends on the other peer.
