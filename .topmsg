Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: add mptcp_for_each_userspace_pm_addr macro

Similar to mptcp_for_each_subflow() macro, this patch adds a new macro
mptcp_for_each_userspace_pm_addr() for userspace PM to iterate over the
address entries on the local address list userspace_pm_local_addr_list
of the mptcp socket.

This patch doesn't change the behaviour of the code, just refactoring.
