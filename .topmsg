Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: stop forcing iptables-legacy

Commit 0c4cd3f86a40 ("selftests: mptcp: join: use 'iptables-legacy' if
available") and commit a5a5990c099d ("selftests: mptcp: sockopt: use
'iptables-legacy' if available") forced using iptables-legacy if
available.

This was needed because of some issues that were visible when testing
the kselftests on a v5.15.x with iptables-nft as default backend. It
looks like these errors are no longer present. As mentioned by Pablo [1],
the errors were maybe due to missing kernel config. We can then use
iptables-nft if it is the default one, instead of using a legacy tool.

We can then check the variables iptables and ip6tables are valid. We can
keep the variables to easily change it later or add options.
