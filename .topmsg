Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: avoid unneeded mptcp_token_destroy() calls

The mptcp protocol currently clears the msk token both at
connect() and listen() time. That was necessary before the
mptcp protocol gained a full disconnect implementation, but
after commit b29fcfb54cd7 ("mptcp: full disconnect implementation")
such calls are no more necessary and a bit confusing.

Just drop them.
