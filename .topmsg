Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: drop free_list for deleting entries

mptcp_pm_remove_addrs() actually only deletes one address, which does
not match its name. This patch renames it to mptcp_pm_remove_addr_entry()
and changes the parameter "rm_list" to "entry".

With the help of mptcp_pm_remove_addr_entry(), it's no longer necessary to
move the entry to be deleted to free_list and then traverse the list to
delete the entry, which is not allowed in BPF. The entry can be directly
deleted through list_del_rcu() and sock_kfree_s() now.
