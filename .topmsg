Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: use mptcp_schedule_work() instead of open-coding it

The helper additionally take cares of checking the msk status
before taking action. That is functionally irrelevant because
the worker itself does nothing if the msk is in CLOSE state.

Just remove a few dups line of code.
