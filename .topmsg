Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: pm: reduce entries iterations on connect

__mptcp_subflow_connect() is currently called from the path-managers,
which have all the required information to create subflows. No need to
call the PM again to re-iterate over the list of entries with RCU lock
to get more info.

Instead, it is possible to pass a mptcp_pm_addr_entry structure, instead
of a mptcp_addr_info one. The former contains the ifindex and the flags
that are required when creating the new subflow.

This is a partial revert of commit ee285257a9c1 ("mptcp: drop flags and
ifindex arguments").

While at it, the local ID can also be set if it is known and 0, to avoid
having to set it in the 'rebuild_header' hook, which will cause a new
iteration of the endpoint entries.
