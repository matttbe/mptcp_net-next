Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: test last time mptcp_info

This patch adds a new helper chk_msk_info() to show the counters in
mptcp_info of the given info, and check that the timestamps move
forward. Use it to show newly added last_data_sent, last_data_recv
and last_ack_recv in mptcp_info in chk_last_time_info().
