Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: fix user-space PM announced address accounting

Currently the per-connection announced address counter is never
decreased. When the user-space PM is in use, this just affect
the information exposed via diag/sockopt, but it could still foul
the PM to wrong decision.

Add the missing accounting for the user-space PM's sake.

Fixes: 8b1c94da1e48 ("mptcp: only send RM_ADDR in nl_cmd_remove")
