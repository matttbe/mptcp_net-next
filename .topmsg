Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: pm: remove mptcp_pm_remove_subflow()

This helper is confusing. It is in pm.c, but it is specific to the
in-kernel PM and it cannot be used by the userspace one. Also, it simply
calls one in-kernel specific function with the PM lock, while the
similar mptcp_pm_remove_addr() helper requires the PM lock.

What's left is the pr_debug(), which is not that useful, because a
similar one is present in the only function called by this helper:

  mptcp_pm_nl_rm_subflow_received()

After these modifications, this helper can be marked as 'static', and
the lock can be taken only once in mptcp_pm_flush_addrs_and_subflows().

Note that it is not a bug fix, but it will help backporting the
following commits.
