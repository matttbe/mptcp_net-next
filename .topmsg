Subject: [PATCH] mailmap: map Geliang's new email address

Just like my other email addresses, map my new one to kernel.org
account too.

My new email address uses "last name, first name" format, which is
different from my other email addresses. This mailmap is also used
to indicate that it is actually the same person.
