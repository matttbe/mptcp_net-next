Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: more operations in ns_init/exit

Set more the default sysctl values in mptcp_lib_ns_init(). It is fine to
do that everywhere, because they could be overridden latter if needed.

mptcp_lib_ns_exit() now also try to remove temp netns files used for the
stats even for selftests not using them. That's fine to do that because
these files have a unique name.
