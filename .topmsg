Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: consolidate subflow cleanup

Consolidate all the cleanup actions requiring the worker in a single
helper and ensure the dummy data fin creation for fallback socket is
performed only when the tcp rx queue is empty.

There are no functional changes intended, but this will simplify the
next patch, when the tcp rx queue spooling could be delayed at release_cb
time.
