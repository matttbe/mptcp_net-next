Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: prefer strscpy over strcpy

strcpy() performs no bounds checking on the destination buffer. This
could result in linear overflows beyond the end of the buffer, leading
to all kinds of misbehaviors. The safe replacement is strscpy() [1].

This is in preparation of a possible future step where all strcpy() uses
will be removed in favour of strscpy() [2].

This fixes CheckPatch warnings:
