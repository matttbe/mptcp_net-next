Subject: [PATCH] MAINTAINERS: Update MPTCP maintainer list and CREDITS

My responsibilities at Intel have changed, so I'm handing off exclusive
MPTCP subsystem maintainer duties to Matthieu. It has been a privilege
to see MPTCP through its initial upstreaming and first few years in the
upstream kernel!
