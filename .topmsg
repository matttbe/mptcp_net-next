Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: consolidate initial ack seq generation

Currently the initial ack sequence is generated on demand whenever
it's requested and the remote key is handy. The relevant code is
scattered in different places and can lead to multiple, unneeded,
crypto operations.

This change consolidate the ack sequence generation code in a single
helper, storing the sequence number at the subflow level.

The above additionally save a few conditional in fast-path and will
simplify the upcoming fast-open implementation.
