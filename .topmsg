Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: implement TCP_NOTSENT_LOWAT support

Add support for such socket option storing the user-space provided
value in a new msk field, and using such data to implement the
_mptcp_stream_memory_free() helper, similar to the TCP one.

To avoid adding more indirect calls in the fast path, open-code
a variant of sk_stream_memory_free() in mptcp_sendmsg() and add
direct calls to the mptcp stream memory free helper where possible.
