Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: only allow set existing scheduler for net.mptcp.scheduler

The current behavior is to accept any strings as inputs, this results in
an inconsistent result where an unexisting scheduler can be set:

  # sysctl -w net.mptcp.scheduler=notdefault
  net.mptcp.scheduler = notdefault

This patch changes this behavior by checking for existing scheduler
before accepting the input.
