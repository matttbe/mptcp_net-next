Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: join: check removing ID 0 endpoint

Removing the endpoint linked to the initial subflow should trigger a
RM_ADDR for the right ID, and the removal of the subflow. That's what is
now being verified in the "delete and re-add" test.

Note that removing the initial subflow will not decrement the 'subflows'
counters, which corresponds to the *additional* subflows. On the other
hand, when the same endpoint is re-added, it will increment this
counter, as it will be seen as an additional subflow this time.

The 'Fixes' tag here below is the same as the one from the previous
commit: this patch here is not fixing anything wrong in the selftests,
but it validates the previous fix for an issue introduced by this commit
ID.
