Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: fix fastclose with csum failure

Running the mp_join selftest manually with the following command line:

  ./mptcp_join.sh -z -C

lead to some failures:

  002 fastclose server test
  # ...
  rtx                                 [fail] got 1 MP_RST[s] TX expected 0
  # ...
  rstrx                               [fail] got 1 MP_RST[s] RX expected 0

the problem is really in the wrong expectations for the RST checks
implied by the csum validation. Note that the same check is repeated
explicitly in the same test-case, with the correct expectation and
pass successfully.

Address the issue explicitly setting the correct expectation for
the failing checks.
