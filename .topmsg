Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: add mptcp_lib_kill_wait

To avoid duplicated code in different MPTCP selftests, we can add
and use helpers defined in mptcp_lib.sh.

Export kill_wait() helper in userspace_pm.sh into mptcp_lib.sh and
rename it as mptcp_lib_kill_wait(). It can be used to instead of
kill_wait() in mptcp_join.sh. Use the new helper in both scripts.
