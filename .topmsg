Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: ensure snd_una is properly initialized on connect

This is strictly related to commit fb7a0d334894 ("mptcp: ensure snd_nxt
is properly initialized on connect"). It turns out that syzkaller can
trigger the retransmit after fallback and before processing any other
incoming packet - so that snd_una is still left uninitialized.

Address the issue explicitly initializing snd_una together with snd_nxt
and write_seq.
