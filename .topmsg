Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: simult flows: fix some subtest names

The selftest was correctly recording all the results, but the 'reverse
direction' part was missing in the name when needed.

It is important to have a unique (sub)test name in TAP, because some CI
environments drop tests with duplicated name.
