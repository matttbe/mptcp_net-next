Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: ensure subflow is unhashed before cleaning the backlog

While tacking care of the mptcp-level listener I unintentionally
moved the subflow level unhash after the subflow listener backlog
cleanup.

That could cause some nasty race and makes the code harder to read.

Address the issue restoring the proper order of operations.
