Subject: [PATCH] Revert "net: rtnetlink: remove local list in __linkwatch_run_queue()"

This reverts commit b8dbbbc535a9 ("net: rtnetlink: remove local list
in __linkwatch_run_queue()"). It's evidently broken when there's a
non-urgent work that gets added back, and then the loop can never
finish.

While reverting, add a note about that.
