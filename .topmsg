Subject: [PATCH] selftests: net: lib: set 'i' as local

Without this, the 'i' variable declared before could be overridden by
accident, e.g.

  for i in "${@}"; do
      __ksft_status_merge "${i}"  ## 'i' has been modified
      foo "${i}"                  ## using 'i' with an unexpected value
  done

After a quick look, it looks like 'i' is currently not used after having
been modified in __ksft_status_merge(), but still, better be safe than
sorry. I saw this while modifying the same file, not because I suspected
an issue somewhere.
