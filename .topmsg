Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: export TEST_COUNTER variable

Variable TEST_COUNT are used in mptcp_connect.sh and mptcp_join.sh as
test counters, which are initialized to 0, while variable test_cnt are used
in diag.sh and simult_flows.sh, which are initialized to 1. To maintain
consistency, this patch renames them all as MPTCP_LIB_TEST_COUNTER,
initializes it to 1, and exports it into mptcp_lib.sh.
