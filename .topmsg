Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: do not keep around the first subflow after disconnect

After the previous patch the first subflow is allocated as
needed at bind, connect, listen time. We don't need anymore
to keep alive the first subflow after a disconnect just to
be able to perform such syscall.

Overall, this change makes the passive and active sockets consistent:
even passive sockets will be allowed to complete life cycle after
disconnect.
