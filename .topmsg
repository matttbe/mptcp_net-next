Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: make pm_remove_addrs_and_subflows static

mptcp_pm_remove_addrs_and_subflows() is only used in pm_netlink.c, it's
no longer used in pm_userspace.c any more since the commit 8b1c94da1e48
("mptcp: only send RM_ADDR in nl_cmd_remove"). So this patch changes it
to a static function.
