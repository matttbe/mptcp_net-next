Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: update userspace pm addr tests

This patch is linked to the previous commit ("mptcp: only send RM_ADDR in
nl_cmd_remove").

To align with what is done by the in-kernel PM, update userspace pm addr
selftests, by sending a remove_subflows command together after the
remove_addrs command.

Fixes: 97040cf9806e ("selftests: mptcp: userspace pm address tests")
