Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: use proper req destructor for IPv6

Before, only the destructor from TCP request sock in IPv4 was called
even if the subflow was IPv6.

It is important to use the right destructor to avoid memory leaks with
some advanced IPv6 features, e.g. when the request socks contain
specific IPv6 options.

Fixes: 79c0949e9a09 ("mptcp: Add key generation and token tree")
