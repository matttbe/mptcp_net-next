Subject: [PATCH] selftests/bpf: Use connect_fd_to_fd in bpf_tcp_ca

To simplify the code, use BPF selftests helper connect_fd_to_fd() in
bpf_tcp_ca.c instead of open-coding it. This helper is defined in
network_helpers.c, and exported in network_helpers.h, which is already
included in bpf_tcp_ca.c.
