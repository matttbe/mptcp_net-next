Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: change local addr type of subflow_destroy

Generally, in the path manager interfaces, the local address is defined as
an mptcp_pm_addr_entry type address, while the remote address is defined as
an mptcp_addr_info type one:

        (struct mptcp_pm_addr_entry *local, struct mptcp_addr_info *remote)

But subflow_destroy() interface uses two mptcp_addr_info type parameters.
This patch changes the first one to mptcp_pm_addr_entry type and use helper
mptcp_pm_parse_entry() to parse it instead of using mptcp_pm_parse_addr().

This patch doesn't change the behaviour of the code, just refactoring.
