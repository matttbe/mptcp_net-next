Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: join: helpers to skip tests

Selftests are supposed to run on any kernels, including the old ones not
supporting all MPTCP features.

Here are some helpers that will be used to mark subtests as skipped if a
feature is not supported. Marking as a fix for the commit introducing
this selftest to help with the backports.

While at it, also check if kallsyms feature is available as it will also
be used in the following commits to check if MPTCP features are
available before starting a test.
