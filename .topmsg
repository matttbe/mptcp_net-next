Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: fix more tx path fields initialization

The 'msk->write_seq' and 'msk->snd_nxt' are always updated under
the msk socket lock, except at MPC handshake completiont time.

Builds-up on the previous commit to move such init under the relevant
lock.

There are no known problems caused by the potential race, the
primary goal is consistency.
