Subject: [PATCH] selftests/bpf: More endpoints for endpoint_init

This patch changes ADDR_2 from "10.0.1.2" to "10.0.2.1", and adds two more
IPv4 test addresses ADDR_3 - ADDR_4, four IPv6 addresses ADDR6_1 - ADDR6_4.
Add a new helper address_init() to initialize all these addresses.

Add a new parameter "endpoints" for endpoint_init() to control how many
endpoints are used for the tests. This makes it more flexible. Update the
parameters of endpoint_init() in test_subflow().
