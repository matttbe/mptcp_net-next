Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: add mptcp_userspace_pm_get_sock helper

Each userspace pm netlink function uses nla_get_u32() to get the msk
token value, then pass it to mptcp_token_get_sock() to get the msk.
Finally check whether userspace PM is selected on this msk. It makes
sense to wrap them into a helper, named mptcp_userspace_pm_get_sock(),
to do this.

This patch doesn't change the behaviour of the code, just refactoring.
