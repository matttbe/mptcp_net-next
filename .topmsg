Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: extract mptcp_lib_check_expected

Extract the main part of check_expected() in userspace_pm.sh to a new
function mptcp_lib_check_expected() in mptcp_lib.sh. It will be used
in both mptcp_john.sh and userspace_pm.sh. check_expected_one() is
moved into mptcp_lib.sh too as mptcp_lib_check_expected_one().
