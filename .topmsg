Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: join: test for flush/re-add endpoints

After having flushed endpoints that didn't cause the creation of new
subflows, it is important to check endpoints can be re-created, re-using
previously used IDs.

Before the previous commit, the client would not have been able to
re-create the subflow that was previously rejected.

The 'Fixes' tag here below is the same as the one from the previous
commit: this patch here is not fixing anything wrong in the selftests,
but it validates the previous fix for an issue introduced by this commit
ID.
