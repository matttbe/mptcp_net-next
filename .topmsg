Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: reset the last TS before the first test

Just to slightly improve the precision of the duration of the first
test.

In mptcp_join.sh, the last append_prev_results is now done as soon as
the last test is over: this will add the last result in the list, and
get a more precise time for this last test.
