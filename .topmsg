Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: add MPTCP_MIB_CURRESTAB counter

Add a new MIB counter named MPTCP_MIB_CURRESTAB to count current
established MPTCP connections, similar to TCP_MIB_CURRESTAB. This is
useful to quickly list the number of MPTCP connections without having to
iterate over all of them.

This patch adds a new helper function mptcp_set_state(): if the state
switches from or to ESTABLISHED state, this newly added counter is
incremented. This helper is going to be used in the following patch.

Similar to MPTCP_INC_STATS(), a new helper called MPTCP_DEC_STATS() is
also needed to decrement a MIB counter.
