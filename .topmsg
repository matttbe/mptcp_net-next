Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: userspace pm: fix printed values

In case of errors, the printed message had the expected and the seen
value inverted.

This patch simply correct the order: first the expected value, then the
one that has been seen.

Fixes: 10d4273411be ("selftests: mptcp: userspace: print error details if any")
