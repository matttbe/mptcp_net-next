Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: join: check re-re-adding ID 0 signal

This test extends "delete re-add signal" to validate the previous
commit: when the 'signal' endpoint linked to the initial subflow (ID 0)
is re-added multiple times, it will re-send the ADD_ADDR with id 0. The
client should still be able to re-create this subflow, even if the
add_addr_accepted limit has been reached as this special address is not
considered as a new address.

The 'Fixes' tag here below is the same as the one from the previous
commit: this patch here is not fixing anything wrong in the selftests,
but it validates the previous fix for an issue introduced by this commit
ID.
