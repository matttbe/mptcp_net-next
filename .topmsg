Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: sockopt: use new helper for TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT

mptcp_setsockopt_sol_tcp_defer() was doing the same thing as
mptcp_setsockopt_first_sf_only() except for the returned code in case of
error.

Ignoring the error is needed to mimic how TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT is handled
when used with "plain" TCP sockets.

The specific function for TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT can be replaced by the new
mptcp_setsockopt_first_sf_only() helper and errors can be ignored to
stay compatible with TCP. A bit of cleanup.
