Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: add mptcpi_subflows_total counter

If the initial subflow has been removed, we cannot know without checking
other counters, e.g. ss -ti <filter> | grep -c tcp-ulp-mptcp or
getsockopt(SOL_MPTCP, MPTCP_FULL_INFO, ...) (or others except MPTCP_INFO
of course) and then check mptcp_subflow_data->num_subflows to get the
total amount of subflows.

This patch adds a new counter mptcpi_subflows_total in mptcpi_flags to
store the total amount of subflows, including the initial one. A new
helper __mptcp_has_initial_subflow() is added to check whether the
initial subflow has been removed or not. With this helper, we can then
compute the total amount of subflows from mptcp_info by doing something
like:

    mptcpi_subflows_total = mptcpi_subflows +
            __mptcp_has_initial_subflow(msk).
