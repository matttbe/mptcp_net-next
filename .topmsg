Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: avoid unneeded indirection in mptcp_stream_accept()

We are going to remove the first subflow socket soon, so avoid
the additional indirection at accept() time. Instead access
directly the first subflow sock, and update mptcp_accept() to
operate on it. This allows dropping a duplicated check in
mptcp_accept().

No functional changes intended.
