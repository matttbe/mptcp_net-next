Subject: [PATCH] bpf: Acquire and release mptcp socket

The KF_TRUSTED_ARGS flag is used for bpf_iter_mptcp_subflow_new, it
indicates that the all pointer arguments are valid. It's necessary to
add a KF_ACQUIRE helper to get valid "msk".

This patch adds bpf_mptcp_sock_acquire() and bpf_mptcp_sock_release()
helpers for this. Increase sk->sk_refcnt in _acquire() and decrease it
in _release(). Register them with KF_ACQUIRE flag and KF_RELEASE flag.
