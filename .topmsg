Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: add a new sysctl for make after break timeout

The MPTCP protocol allows sockets with no alive subflows to stay
in ESTABLISHED status for and user-defined timeout, to allow for
later subflows creation.

Currently such timeout is constant - TCP_TIMEWAIT_LEN. Let the
user-space configure them via a newly added sysctl, to better cope
with busy servers and simplify (make them faster) the relevant
pktdrill tests.

Note that the new know does not apply to orphaned MPTCP socket
waiting for the data_fin handshake completion: they always wait
TCP_TIMEWAIT_LEN.
