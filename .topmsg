Subject: [PATCH] selftests/bpf: Add bpf_bkup test

This patch adds the backup BPF MPTCP scheduler test: test_bkup(). Use
sysctl to set net.mptcp.scheduler to use this sched. Add two veth net
devices to simulate the multiple addresses case. Use 'ip mptcp endpoint'
command to add the new endpoint ADDR_2 to PM netlink with backup flag.
Send data, check bytes_sent of 'ss' output, and do some cleanups.
