Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: check subflow and addr infos

New MPTCP info are being checked in multiple places to improve the code
coverage when using the userspace PM.

This patch makes chk_mptcp_info() more generic to be able to check
subflows, add_addr_signal and add_addr_accepted info (and even more
later). New arguments are now required to get different infos from the
two namespaces because some counters are specific to the client or the
server.
