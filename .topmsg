Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: add subflow unique id

The user-space need to properly account the data received/sent by
individual subflows. When additional subflows are created and/or
closed during the MPTCP socket lifetime, the information currently
exposed via MPTCP_TCPINFO are not enough: subflows are identified only
by the sequential position inside the info dumps, and that will change
with the above mentioned events.

To solve the above problem, this patch introduces a new subflow
identifier that is unique inside the given MPTCP socket scope.

The initial subflow get the id 1 and the other subflows get incremental
values at join time.
