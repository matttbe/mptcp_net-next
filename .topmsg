Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: fix bad RCVPRUNED mib accounting

Since its introduction, the mentioned MIB accounted for the wrong
event: wake-up being skipped as not-needed on some edge condition
instead of incoming skb being dropped after landing in the (subflow)
receive queue.

Move the increment in the correct location.

Fixes: ce599c516386 ("mptcp: properly account bulk freed memory")
