Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: check addrs list in userspace_pm_get_local_id

Before adding a new entry in mptcp_userspace_pm_get_local_id(), it's
better to check whether this address is already in userspace pm local
address list. If it's in the list, no need to add a new entry, just
return it's address ID and use this address.
