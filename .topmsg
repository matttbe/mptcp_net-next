Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: don't overwrite sock_ops in mptcp_is_tcpsk()

re-factor code to avoid overwriting sock_ops inside that function. Also,
change the helper name to reflect the semantics and to disambiguate from
its dual, sk_is_mptcp(). While at it, collapse mptcp_stream_accept() and
mptcp_accept() into a single function, where fallback / non-fallback are
separated into a single sk_is_mptcp() conditional.
