Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: SO_KEEPALIVE: fix getsockopt support

SO_KEEPALIVE support has to be set on each subflow: on each TCP socket,
where sk_prot->keepalive is defined. Technically, nothing has to be done
on the MPTCP socket. That's why mptcp_sol_socket_sync_intval() was
called instead of mptcp_sol_socket_intval().

Except that when nothing is done on the MPTCP socket, the
getsockopt(SO_KEEPALIVE), handled in net/core/sock.c:sk_getsockopt(),
will not know if SO_KEEPALIVE has been set on the different subflows or
not.

The fix is simple: simply call mptcp_sol_socket_intval() which will end
up calling net/core/sock.c:sk_setsockopt() where the SOCK_KEEPOPEN flag
will be set, the one used in sk_getsockopt().

So now, getsockopt(SO_KEEPALIVE) on an MPTCP socket will return the same
value as the one previously set with setsockopt(SO_KEEPALIVE).
