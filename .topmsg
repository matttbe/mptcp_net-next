Subject: [PATCH] selftests/bpf: Add bpf_red test

This patch adds the redundant BPF MPTCP scheduler test: test_red(). Use
sysctl to set net.mptcp.scheduler to use this sched. Add two veth net
devices to simulate the multiple addresses case. Use 'ip mptcp endpoint'
command to add the new endpoint ADDR_2 to PM netlink. Send data and check
bytes_sent of 'ss' output after it to make sure the data has been
redundantly sent on both net devices.
