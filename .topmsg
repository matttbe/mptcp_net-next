Subject: [PATCH] selftests/bpf: use random netns name for mptcp

Use rand() to generate a random netns name instead of using the fixed
name "mptcp_ns" for every test.

By doing that, we can re-launch the test even if there was an issue
removing the previous netns or if by accident, a netns with this generic
name already existed on the system.

Note that using a different name each will also help adding more
subtests in future commits.
