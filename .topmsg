Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: listener test for in-kernel PM

This patch adds test coverage for listening sockets created by the
in-kernel path manager in mptcp_join.sh.

It adds the listener event checking in the existing "remove single
address with port" test. The output looks like this:

 003 remove single address with port syn[ ok ] - synack[ ok ] - ack[ ok ]
                                     add[ ok ] - echo  [ ok ] - pt [ ok ]
                                     syn[ ok ] - synack[ ok ] - ack[ ok ]
                                     syn[ ok ] - ack   [ ok ]
                                     rm [ ok ] - rmsf  [ ok ]   invert
                                     CREATE_LISTENER 10.0.2.1:10100[ ok ]
                                     CLOSE_LISTENER 10.0.2.1:10100 [ ok ]
