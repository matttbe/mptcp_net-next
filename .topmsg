Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: fix NL PM announced address accounting

Currently the per connection announced address counter is never
decreased. As a consequence, after connection establishment, if
the NL PM deletes an endpoint and adds a new/different one, no
additional subflow is created for the new endpoint even if the
current limits allow that.

Address the issue properly updating the signaled address counter
every time the NL PM removes such addresses.
