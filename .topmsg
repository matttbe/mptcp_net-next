Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: join: one line for join check

Most tests are checking if the expected number of SYN/SYN+ACK/ACK JOINs
have been received, each of them on one line.

More Join related tests are going to be checked soon, no need to add 5
new lines per test in case of success, just one is enough. In case of
issue, the errors will still be reported like before.
