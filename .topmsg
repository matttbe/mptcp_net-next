Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: userspace pm allow creating id 0 subflow

This patch drops id 0 limitation in mptcp_nl_cmd_sf_create() to allow
creating additional subflows with the local addr ID 0.

There is no reason not to allow additional subflows from this local
address: we should be able to create new subflows from the initial
endpoint. This limitation was breaking fullmesh support from userspace.

Fixes: 702c2f646d42 ("mptcp: netlink: allow userspace-driven subflow establishment")
Closes: https://github.com/multipath-tcp/mptcp_net-next/issues/391
