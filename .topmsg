Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: userspace_pm: fixed subtest names

It is important to have a fixed (sub)test names in TAP, because these
names are used to identify them. If they are not fixed, tracking cannot
be done.

Some subtests from the userspace_pm selftest were using random numbers
in their names: address IDs from $RANDOM, and the client port number
randomly picked by the kernel when creating the connection. These values
have been replaced by 'client' and 'server' words: that's even more
helpful than showing random numbers. Note that the addresses IDs are
incremented and decremented in the test: +1 or -1 are then displayed.

Not to loose info that can be useful for debugging in case of issues,
these random numbers are now displayed at the beginning of the test.
