Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: simult flows: re-adapt BW

Recently, the bandwidth in simult flows selftest has been reduced. The
idea was to improve the situation in slow environments. It helped in
some, but not in all of them. With a longer transfer, it is also
possible to get more instabilities along the way.

We can increase a bit the rate limit for the unbalanced bandwidth cases,
but limit the total of the two links to 20 Mbps, like the balanced
bandwidth cases. The same 3:1 ratio is still being used like before, not
to change the nature of the test.
