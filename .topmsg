Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: unify pm get_local_id interfaces

This patch unifies the three PM get_local_id() interfaces:

mptcp_pm_nl_get_local_id() in mptcp/pm_netlink.c for the in-kernel PM and
mptcp_userspace_pm_get_local_id() in mptcp/pm_userspace.c for the
userspace PM.

They'll be switched in the common PM infterface mptcp_pm_get_local_id()
in mptcp/pm.c based on whether mptcp_pm_is_userspace() or not.

Also put together the declarations of these three functions in protocol.h.
