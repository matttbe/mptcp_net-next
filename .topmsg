Subject: [PATCH] Revert "Merge tag '9p-6.4-for-linus' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ericvh/v9fs"

This reverts commit 8e15605be8baeb9e3957c268c7d6f901c327ad5c which
includes:

  d9bc0d11e33b fs/9p: Consolidate file operations and add readahead and writeback
  740b8bf87322 fs/9p: Remove unnecessary superblock flags
  8142db4f2792 fs/9p: allow disable of xattr support on mount
  46c30cb8f539 9p: Add additional debug flags and open modes
  6deffc8924b5 fs/9p: Add new mount modes
  1543b4c5071c fs/9p: remove writeback fid and fix per-file modes
  4eb3117888a9 fs/9p: Rework cache modes and add new options to Documentation
  21e26d5e54ab fs/9p: Fix bit operation logic error

These modifications and mainly the first one with commit d9bc0d11e33b
("fs/9p: Consolidate file operations and add readahead and writeback")
seem to cause instabilities in MPTCP tests, see the linked ticket for
more details.

As a temporarily solution, these modifications are reverted here.
