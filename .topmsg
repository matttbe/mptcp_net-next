Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: add print_title in mptcp_lib

This patch adds a new variable MPTCP_LIB_TEST_FORMAT as the test title
printing format. Also add a helper mptcp_lib_print_title() to use this
format to print the test title with test counters. They are used in
mptcp_join.sh first.

Each MPTCP selftest is having subtests, and it helps to give them a
number to quickly identify them. This can be managed by mptcp_lib.sh,
reusing what has been done here. The following commit will use these
new helpers in the other tests.
