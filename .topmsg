Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: join: stop transfer when check is done

Since the mentioned commit, the "userspace pm" tests of mptcp_join
selftests are launching the whole transfer in the background, do the
required checks, then wait for the end of transfer.

There is no need to wait longer, especially because the checks at the
end of the transfer are ignored (which is fine). This saves quite a few
seconds on slow environments.

While at it, use 'mptcp_lib_kill_wait()' helper everywhere, instead of
on a specific one with 'kill_tests_wait()'. Note that old versions will
need commit bdbef0a6ff10 ("selftests: mptcp: add mptcp_lib_kill_wait")
as well.

Fixes: 4369c198e599 ("selftests: mptcp: test userspace pm out of transfer")
