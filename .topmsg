Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: track some aggregate data counters

Currently there are no data transfer counters accounting for all
the subflows used by a given MPTCP socket. The user-space can compute
such figures aggregating the subflow info, but that is inaccurate
if any subflow is closed before the MPTCP socket itself.

Add the new counters in the MPTCP socket itself and expose them
via the existing diag and sockopt. While touching mptcp_diag_fill_info(),
acquire the relevant locks before fetching the msk data, to ensure
better data consistency
