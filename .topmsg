Subject: [PATCH] selftest: mptcp: add test for mptcp socket in use

Add the function chk_msk_inuse() to diag.sh, which is used to check the
statistics of mptcp socket in use. As mptcp socket in listen state will
be closed randomly after 'accept', we need to get the count of listening
mptcp socket through 'ss' command.

All tests pass.
