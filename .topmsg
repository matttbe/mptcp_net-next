Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: distinguish rcv vs sent backup flag in requests

When sending an MP_JOIN + SYN + ACK, it is possible to mark the subflow
as 'backup' by setting the flag with the same name. Before this patch,
the backup was set if the other peer set it in its MP_JOIN + SYN
request.

It is not correct: the backup flag should be set in the MPJ+SYN+ACK only
if the host asks for it, and not mirroring what was done by the other
peer. It is then required to have a dedicated bit for each direction,
similar to what is done in the subflow context.
