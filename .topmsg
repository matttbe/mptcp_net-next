Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: sockopt: make 'tcp_fastopen_connect' generic

There are other socket options that need to act only on the first
subflow, e.g. all TCP_FASTOPEN* socket options.

This is similar to the getsockopt version.

In the next commit, this new mptcp_setsockopt_first_sf_only() helper is
used by other another option.
