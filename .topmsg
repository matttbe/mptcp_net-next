Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: join: check re-adding init endp with != id

The initial subflow has a special local ID: 0. It is specific per
connection.

When a global endpoint is deleted and re-added later, it can have a
different ID, but the kernel should still use the ID 0 if it corresponds
to the initial address.

This test validates this behaviour: the endpoint linked to the initial
subflow is removed, and re-added with a different ID.

Note that removing the initial subflow will not decrement the 'subflows'
counters, which corresponds to the *additional* subflows. On the other
hand, when the same endpoint is re-added, it will increment this
counter, as it will be seen as an additional subflow this time.

The 'Fixes' tag here below is the same as the one from the previous
commit: this patch here is not fixing anything wrong in the selftests,
but it validates the previous fix for an issue introduced by this commit
ID.
