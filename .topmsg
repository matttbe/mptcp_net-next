Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: rm subflow with v4/v4mapped addr

Now both a v4 address and a v4-mapped address are supported when
destroying a userspace pm subflow, this patch adds a second subflow
to "userspace pm add & remove address" test, and two subflows could
be removed two different ways, one with the v4mapped and one with v4.
