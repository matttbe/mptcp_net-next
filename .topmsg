Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: add mptcp_lib_make_file

To avoid duplicated code in different MPTCP selftests, we can add
and use helpers defined in mptcp_lib.sh.

make_file() helper in mptcp_sockopt.sh and userspace_pm.sh are the same.
Export it into mptcp_lib.sh and rename it as mptcp_lib_kill_wait(). Use
it in both mptcp_connect.sh and mptcp_join.sh.
