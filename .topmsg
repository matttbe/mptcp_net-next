Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: join: check re-re-adding ID 0 endp

This test extends "delete and re-add" to validate the previous commit:
when the endpoint linked to the initial subflow (ID 0) is re-added
multiple times, it was no longer being used, because the internal linked
counters are not decremented for this special endpoint: it is not an
additional endpoint.

Here, the "del/add id 0" steps are done 3 times to unsure this case is
validated.

The 'Fixes' tag here below is the same as the one from the previous
commit: this patch here is not fixing anything wrong in the selftests,
but it validates the previous fix for an issue introduced by this commit
ID.

Fixes: 3ad14f54bd74 ("mptcp: more accurate MPC endpoint tracking")
