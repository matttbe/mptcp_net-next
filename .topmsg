Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: handle correctly disconnect() failures

Currently the mptcp code has assumes that disconnect() can fail only
at mptcp_sendmsg_fastopen() time - to avoid a deadlock scenario - and
don't even bother returning an error code.

Soon mptcp_disconnect() will handle more error conditions: let's track
them explicitly.

As a bonus, explicitly annotate TCP-level disconnect as not failing:
the mptcp code never blocks for event on the subflows.
