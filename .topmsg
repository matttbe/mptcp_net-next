Subject: [PATCH] net: factor out inet{,6}_bind_sk helpers

The mptcp protocol maintains an additional socket just to easily
invoke a few stream operations on the first subflow. One of
them is bind().

Factor out the helpers operating directly on the struct sock, to
allow get rid of the above dependency in the next patch without
duplicating the existing code.

No functional changes intended.
