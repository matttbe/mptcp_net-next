Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: lib: add time per subtests in TAP output

It adds 'time=<N>ms' in the diagnostic data of the TAP output, e.g.

  ok 1 - pm_netlink: defaults addr list # time=9ms

This addition is useful to quickly identify which subtests are taking a
longer time than the others, or more than expected.

Note that there are no specific formats to follow to show this time
according to the TAP 13 [1], TAP 14 [2] and KTAP [3] specifications.
Let's then define this one here.
