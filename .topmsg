Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: remove MPTCP 'ifdef' in TCP SYN cookies

To ease the maintenance, it is often recommended to avoid having #ifdef
preprocessor conditions.

Here the section related to CONFIG_MPTCP was quite short but the next
commit needs to add more code around. It is then cleaner to move
specific MPTCP code to functions located in net/mptcp directory.

Now that mptcp_subflow_request_sock_ops structure can be static, it can
also be marked as "read only after init".
