Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: add tc check for check_tools

tc are used in some test scripts: mptcp_connect.sh, mptcp_join.sh and
simult_flows.sh. It makes sense to check if tc is installed before running
these scripts, just like other tools. So this patch add 'tc' check for
mptcp_lib_check_tools(), and check it in these test scripts.
