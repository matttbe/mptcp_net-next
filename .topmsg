Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: rename timer related helper to less confusing names

The msk socket uses to different timeout to track close related
events and retransmissions. The existing helpers do not indicate
clearly which timer they actually touch, making the related code
quite confusing.

Change the existing helpers name to avoid such confusion. No
functional change intended.
