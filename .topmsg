Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: fix for setting remote ipv4mapped address

Commit 1c670b39cec7 ("mptcp: change local addr type of subflow_destroy")
introduced a bug in mptcp_pm_nl_subflow_destroy_doit().

ipv6_addr_set_v4mapped() should be called to set the remote ipv4 address
'addr_r.addr.s_addr' to the remote ipv6 address 'addr_r.addr6', not
'addr_l.addr.addr6', which is the local ipv6 address.
