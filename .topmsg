Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: add mptcp_lib_is_v6

To avoid duplicated code in different MPTCP selftests, we can add
and use helpers defined in mptcp_lib.sh.

is_v6() helper is defined in mptcp_connect.sh, mptcp_join.sh and
mptcp_sockopt.sh, so export it into mptcp_lib.sh and rename it as
mptcp_lib_is_v6(). Use this new helper in all scripts.
