Subject: [PATCH] selftests/bpf: Add mptcp subflow example

Move Nicolas' patch into bpf selftests directory. This example adds a
different mark (SO_MARK) on each subflow, and changes the TCP CC only on
the first subflow.

From the userspace, an application can do a setsockopt() on an MPTCP
socket, and typically the same value will be propagated to all subflows
(paths). If someone wants to have different values per subflow, the
recommended way is to use BPF. So it is good to add such example here,
and make sure there is no regressions.

This example shows how it is possible to:

    Identify the parent msk of an MPTCP subflow.
    Put different sockopt for each subflow of a same MPTCP connection.

Here especially, two different behaviours are implemented:

    A socket mark (SOL_SOCKET SO_MARK) is put on each subflow of a same
    MPTCP connection. The order of creation of the current subflow defines
    its mark. The TCP CC algorithm of the very first subflow of an MPTCP
    connection is set to "reno".

This is just to show it is possible to identify an MPTCP connection, and
set socket options, from different SOL levels, per subflow. It is easy
to verify with 'ss' that these modifications have been applied
correctly. That's what the next patch is going to do.

Nicolas' code comes from:

    commit 4d120186e4d6 ("bpf:examples: update mptcp_set_mark_kern.c")

from the MPTCP repo https://github.com/multipath-tcp/mptcp_net-next (the
"scripts" branch), and it has been adapted by Geliang.
