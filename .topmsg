Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: cleanup state propagation

When propagating the first subflow state via the release_cb, the
msk must actually take to 2 separate actions: state sync-up and
send buffer sync-up. Relaying on the specific flags instead of
bounding both in __mptcp_sync_state(), allows cleaning up a bit
the code.
