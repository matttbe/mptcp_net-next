Subject: [PATCH] bpf: Add bpf_mptcp_sched_ops

This patch implements a new struct bpf_struct_ops: bpf_mptcp_sched_ops.
Register and unregister the bpf scheduler in .reg and .unreg.

Add write access for the scheduled flag of struct mptcp_subflow_context
in .btf_struct_access.

This MPTCP BPF scheduler implementation is similar to BPF TCP CC. And
net/ipv4/bpf_tcp_ca.c is a frame of reference for this patch.
