Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: use mptcp_schedule_work instead of open-coding it

Beyond reducing code duplication this also avoids scheduling
the mptcp_worker on a closed socket on some edge scenarios.

The addressed issue is actually older than the blamed commit
below, but this fix needs it as a pre-requisite.
