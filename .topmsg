Subject: [PATCH] DO-NOT-MERGE: git markup: end common net net-next

All commits older than this one are patches that are needed for both the
-net and the net-next trees.

Following commits are MPTCP-related modifications only needed for -net.

This commit is useful to easily find where are commits needed for -net
and net-next.
