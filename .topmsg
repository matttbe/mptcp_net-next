Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: annotate lockless access for the tx path

The mptcp-level TX path info (write_seq, bytes_sent, snd_nxt) are under
the msk socket lock protection, and are accessed lockless in a few spots.

Always mark the write operations with WRITE_ONCE, read operations
outside the lock with READ_ONCE and drop the annotation for read
under such lock.

To simplify the annotations move mptcp_pending_data_fin_ack() from
__mptcp_data_acked() to __mptcp_clean_una(), under the msk socket
lock, where such call would belong.
